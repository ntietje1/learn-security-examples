- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

In the insecure version, the id field is not sanitized and therefore is vulnerable to injection attacks. Specifically, an attacker could put a query with a WHERE clause with an extremely long time to execute script within it.
The id field should be sanitized and checked before being used in any kind of query to be executed.
