The vulnerability is in the session management. In the insecure version, if someone obtained the information in the cookie, they could pose as that user. To fix this, there needs to be checks in place to enforce that sessions only continue from the same origin/ip address.

This violates confidentiality as a user's information could be accessed by an unauthorized user.
